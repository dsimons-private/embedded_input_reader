## Overview

- **Course Provider:** Udacity
- **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
- **Topics Covered:** Microcontrollers, Microprocessors, Peripheral Devices, Analog and Digital Signals, Logic Circuits, Breadboarding, Synchronous and Asynchronous Processing, UART Protocol[1][2]

## Project Description

The final project for this course involves designing and implementing a microprocessor-based, digital device-control interface.
- **Prototype circuits** using breadboards.
- **Work with logic circuits** and digital signals.
- **Implement control logic** based on truth tables.
- **Understand synchronous and asynchronous processing** in embedded systems.

Goal of this project is to be able to design embedded systems and decode simple messages using the UART protocol.
